# MCP Weather Server Refactor & Deployment Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring completed for the MCP Weather Server to work properly with your VS Code MCP client configuration and provides deployment instructions.

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Critical Logic Error in tools/call Handler**

- **Problem**: The `tools/call` case in the switch statement was missing a `break` statement, causing it to fall through to the `default` case and return "Method not found" error.
- **Fix**: Added proper `break` statement to allow the tools/call method to continue to the weather API processing logic.

### 2. **Geocoding Service Compatibility**

- **Problem**: The Open-Meteo geocoding API doesn't recognize certain location formats like "London,UK" but works with "London".
- **Fix**: Implemented intelligent location parsing that tries multiple variants:
  - Original location string
  - Location without ",UK" suffix
  - Location without ",US" or ",USA" suffix
  - Location without ",England" suffix
- **Result**: Much better success rate for location geocoding.

### 3. **Enhanced Error Handling**

- **Problem**: Generic error messages that didn't help users understand what went wrong.
- **Fix**: Added detailed error responses with helpful suggestions for location formatting.

## Key Refactored Files

### 1. `controllers/mcpController.js`

**Major Changes:**

- Fixed missing `break` statement in `tools/call` case
- Enhanced geocoding logic with multiple location format attempts
- Improved error messages with user-friendly suggestions
- Better logging for debugging geocoding issues

### 2. Enhanced Testing Suite

**New Files Created:**

- `test-complete-mcp.js` - Comprehensive test suite for all MCP functionality
- `test-geocoding.js` - Specific tests for geocoding API behavior
- `debug-tools-call.js` - Detailed debugging for tools/call endpoint

## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Manual Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Upload the refactored files to your Render.com deployment:**

   ```bash
   # If using Git deployment
   git add controllers/mcpController.js
   git commit -m "Fix MCP tools/call handler and improve geocoding"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Trigger a new deployment on Render.com:**
   - Go to your Render dashboard
   - Find your MCP weather server service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"

### Option 2: Direct File Upload

If you're not using Git deployment:

1. Download the refactored `controllers/mcpController.js` file
2. Upload it to your Render.com service via their file manager
3. Restart the service

## Testing the Deployment

### Quick Test

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
node test-complete-mcp.js
```

### Expected Results

The test should show:

- ‚úÖ Initialize request successful
- ‚úÖ Tools list request successful
- ‚úÖ Weather requests successful for valid locations
- ‚úÖ Appropriate error handling for invalid locations
- ‚úÖ Health check successful

### VS Code MCP Configuration

Your existing configuration should work perfectly:

```json
"weather-server-deployed": {
  "url": "https://mcp-weather-server-o6o8.onrender.com/mcp",
  "transportType": "http",
  "autoApprove": [],
  "disabled": false,
  "timeout": 60,
  "retryCount": 3,
  "retryDelay": 2000,
  "keepAlive": true,
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "User-Agent": "vscode-mcp-client/1.0.0",
    "Accept": "application/json",
    "Connection": "keep-alive"
  },
  "healthCheck": {
    "enabled": true,
    "url": "https://mcp-weather-server-o6o8.onrender.com/mcp/health",
    "interval": 30000
  }
}
```

## API Improvements

### Enhanced Location Support

The server now supports these location formats:

- ‚úÖ `"London"` (recommended)
- ‚úÖ `"London,UK"` (now works via fallback)
- ‚úÖ `"New York"`
- ‚úÖ `"Paris, France"`
- ‚úÖ Direct coordinates: `{"latitude": 51.5074, "longitude": -0.1278}`

### Better Error Messages

When a location can't be found, users now receive:

- Clear error message explaining the issue
- Helpful suggestions for alternative formats
- Examples of working location formats

## Weather Data Features

The MCP server provides:

- üå°Ô∏è Current temperature
- üí® Wind speed and direction
- ‚è∞ Current time at location
- üìç Exact coordinates
- üïê Timezone information
- üìÖ 3-day forecast (min/max temperatures)

## Monitoring & Logs

### Health Check Endpoint

- URL: `https://mcp-weather-server-o6o8.onrender.com/mcp/health`
- Returns server status and capabilities
- Used by VS Code for connection monitoring

### Rate Limiting

- General: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- MCP endpoint: 50 requests per 5 minutes
- Authentication: 5 requests per 15 minutes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Method not found: tools/call"**

   - **Cause**: Old version still deployed
   - **Solution**: Ensure the refactored controller is deployed and service is restarted

2. **Location not found errors**

   - **Cause**: Geocoding API limitations
   - **Solution**: Try simpler location names (e.g., "London" instead of "London,UK")

3. **Timeout errors**
   - **Cause**: External API delays
   - **Solution**: Increase timeout in VS Code configuration or retry

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test specific location
node debug-tools-call.js

# Test geocoding directly
node test-geocoding.js

# Full test suite
node test-complete-mcp.js
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the refactored code** to Render.com
2. **Run the test suite** to verify functionality
3. **Test with VS Code** using your existing configuration
4. **Monitor the health check** endpoint for ongoing status

The server should now work seamlessly with your VS Code MCP client configuration and provide reliable weather data through HTTP requests to the Open-Meteo API.
